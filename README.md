# Unfortunately
## I no longer have access to Fruity
### I lost access to my pypi account and fruity is going to have to be worked on heavily in order to combat this unfortunate event

# fruity
My first pip package, all about fruits!

# GET
To install run the command "pip install fruity" in any terminal that has python or "python -m pip install fruity" for linux users...

There are errors at this stage and it is currently unavailable to be installed for errors that I am fixing currently.
If you would like to get the source code go to
https://pypi.org/project/fruity/#files
And to go to the main site, Go to https://pypi.org/project/fruity/

# ISSUES

Currently there are some unresolved issues
Listed below are all the issues I found :

**-** If you open a python script and do import fruity, it will appear like it has not been downloaded
**-** It won't work if you download a specific version, just 'pip install fruity'...
